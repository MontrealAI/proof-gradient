# GoalOS Cloud MVP 0.2

## Purpose

Document the public software proof.

## Current status

GoalOS Cloud MVP 0.2 is a browser-local public software proof under `site/app/goalos-cloud-mvp/`; it is not a full SaaS.

## Key decisions

Keep secrets out of the MVP, preserve localStorage-only behavior, and use it to demonstrate workflow proof mechanics.

## Files involved

- `README.md`
- `docs/data/goalos_catalog.yml`
- `docs/tables/`
- `docs/figures/`
- `scripts/check_no_paid_artifacts.py`
- `scripts/validate_goalos_public_site.py`
- `scripts/validate_docs_tables_figures.py`
- `scripts/validate_goalos_catalog.py`


## What is public

Public: standards, public docs, schemas, examples, public proof pages, public site assets, product names, safe status language, and shop/application links to QUEBEC.AI.

## What must remain private

Private: paid buyer ZIPs, workshop bundles, delivery kits, implementation bundles, enterprise pilot bundles, commercial operating packs, buyer data, private evidence, and private professional-firm package ZIPs.

## Next actions

Run Node tests, add public-safe proof export examples, and avoid production SaaS claims.
